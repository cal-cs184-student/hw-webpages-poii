		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this assignment, we implemented de Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate Bezier curves and surfaces, Phong shading 
			for triangle meshes, and various mesh operations like edge flip, edge split, and loop subdivision. Implementing 
			Bezier curve evaluation gave a good introduction to working with points in space, which is done a lot when 
			implementing mesh operations. Overall, there was a lot of playing around with the halfedge data structure for 
			mesh traversal, and drawing things out helped a lot with this assignment. In fact, if we didn't draw things out, 
			then the possibility for error was really high, considering all of the shifting parts throughout the assignment. 
			Something we found interesting was that no matter how complicated or odd your mesh is, since we are working with 
			triangle meshes, the basic diagrams we drew could be applied to any arbitrarily complicated meshes.
		</p>

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>
			De Casteljau's algorithm is a way to evaluate Bezier curves by recursively subdividing given edges with linearly 
			interpolating through the edges' control points. Given a parameter t, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, and n control points, we 
			want to place n - 1 new points, per “level” of de Casteljau's algorithm. Following a consistent ordering of control 
			points, new points can be defined ((1 - t) * the previous control point) * (t * the next control point). Successively 
			connecting all of your new points with edges will give you a new line with new control points. Recursively applying 
			this algorithm with your new lines until you reach a singular point will yield a point on your desired Bezier curve. 
			If you were to evaluate this algorithm for every value of t ranging from 0 to 1, your set of final points would trace 
			out your entire Bezier curve.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To implement de Casteljau's algorithm in Task 1, we iterated from the beginning to the end of our given points. At each 
			iteration, we set a new_point = (1 - t) * p_i + t * p_i1, where p_i is an arbitrary point and p_i1 is the next consecutive 
			point. We then added this new_point to a new_points vector using push_back() and repeated it until we finished iterating 
			through our given points. Finally, we returned the new_points vector.
		</p>

		<p>Here is our own Bezier curve with 6 control points at various levels of de Casteljau's algorithm.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>
			As we know, we can use de Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate Bezier curves with n control 
			points placed on a 2-dimensional plane. To expand this to an nxn Bezier surface, given a set of 
			n Bezier curves, we can evaluate a common parametric point along each of the Bezier curves 
			to give us a set of n points in the orthogonal direction. Applying de Casteljau's algorithm 
			to these n orthogonal points with a varying parameter will give us a new Bezier curve that 
			results in a Bezier surface when swept out across the original set of Bezier curves.
		</p>

		<p>
			To implement this, we first set BezierPatch::evaluateStep to do the same thing as its BezierCurve 
			counterpart, but with 3D vectors instead of 2D now that we're working with 3 dimensions. Then, we 
			implemented BezierPatch::evaluate1D to recursively apply 1 step of the de Casteljau's algorithm to 
			a given set of points and parameter t until we reach the final step where a single point is returned. 
			Next, we implemented BezierPatch::evaluate, which takes in u and v values, where 0 ≤ u ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ v ≤ 1, 
			and returns a point P that lies on our desired Bezier surface given parameters u and v. To do this, we 
			first have evaluate1D called on every single n-length row of our original control points, with u as the 
			t parameter. This yields a set of n control points, which we'll call u_points, that are facing the other 
			axis (when compared to our rows). Then, we can use evaluate1D called on our u_points and with v as the t 
			parameter. This will result in a point P that lies on our desired Bezier surface given u and v, and to 
			evaluate the entire Bezier surface, you would just sweep through all possible combinations of u 
			and v values.

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<p>
			When evaluating the area-weighted vertex normals for an arbitrary vertex v, we need to calculate the normal 
			vectors at each of v's neighboring vertices and then normalize their sum. The normal vector of a neighboring 
			vertex w can be calculated by taking the cross product of v's outgoing edge that points to w with the following 
			halfedge going out of w. So, we'll iterate through all of v's outgoing halfedges and use each of them as a 
			reference point to perform our desired cross product calculation. 
		</p>
		<p>
			To iterate through all of v's outgoing halfedges, we can first start at the halfedge assigned to v, which we'll 
			call h1. Then, we can traverse to h1's following halfedge, and then the half edge after that. Since we are working 
			with triangle meshes, at this point, we'll find ourselves at a halfedge pointing at v. From there, you can traverse 
			to our current halfedge's twin, giving you v's next outgoing halfedge. Here, you can continue to perform the desired 
			cross product calculation and then move onto v's next outgoing halfedge through the same traversal.
		</p>
		<p>
			As for the specific cross product calculation, we implemented this by using point position subtraction to define vectors 
			for our calculations. Let's define our original point as v, the point that v's outgoing halfedge points to as w, and the 
			point that w's outgoing halfedge points to as k. Then, we can define the vector v1, or the vector going out of v and 
			pointing to w, as w - v and vector v2, or the vector going out of w and pointing to k, as k - w. Taking the cross product 
			of v1 and v2 gives us our desired vector norm for point w. Summing up the result of this calculation over all of v's 
			neighbors as w gives us a vector j, where we can normalize j by dividing it by its own magnitude to get our desired 
			area-weighted vertex normal.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<p>
			To implement the edge flip operation, we need to first establish and define every relevant mesh element with respect 
			to the edge we are operating on. Given that we are only operating with triangle meshes, we know that the edge we are 
			operating on bisects 2 triangles. By using the halfedge associated with our edge as a “home” reference point, we can 
			traverse and define every mesh element associated with our two triangles with respect to our edge. Once we define 
			every mesh element, we can perform the edge flip operation by reassigning what each mesh element's member variables 
			point to. We used a combination of individual assignment and the setNeighbors helperfunction to do so.
		</p>
		<p>Here is the edge flip in action.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">


			  <tr>

				  <figcaption>Teapot mesh with some edge flips.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>

			  
  
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>
			As a visual aid, we drew out what the edge flip operation would look like by hand and labeled every mesh element on 
			the diagram. This allowed us to inspect how mesh elements changed with respect to their surroundings, and we found 
			that a simple visual way of thinking about an edge flip was that “every element inside the quadrilatteral rotated 90 
			degrees counterclockwise.”
		</p>

		<p>Here is the diagram we drew.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/task4before.jpg" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Before the edge flip on e0.</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/task4after.jpg" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>After performing the edge flip on e0.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			
			  
			</table>
		</div>
		

		<p>
			At this point, the only bug we ran into saw edge flips causing portions of the mech to disappear. Since we knew that our 
			code did not explicitly delete any mesh elements, we must have defined/reassigned some mesh elements incorrectly. So, we 
			consulted our diagram and found an inconsistency with one of the halfedges' member variables defined in our code (when 
			compared to what is was on the diagram). We changed it accordingly, which resulted in the desired functionality.
		</p>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<p>
			Similar to implementing the edge flip operation, implementing the edge split operation involves a lot of mesh element 
			definitions and reassignment. However, since edge splitting creates a new edge, vertex, and 2 new triangles, we needed to 
			define new mesh elements and assign them accordingly. After defining every initial mesh element, we then created the 4 new 
			inner edges that connect the new vertex m, while defining the edge that connects m and b, or mb, equal to e0. Now, using 
			this mb edge as a “home” reference, we can define the new halfedges, edges, faces, and vertex m with respect to edge mb. 
			Once again, we used halfedge traversal, individual assignment, and the setNeighbors helper function to achieve this. 
			Finally, we set the position of m to the average position between the points on the “left and right” of m and assigned m's 
			halfedge to its appropriate object. Another thing we did was set the new edges' isNew member variables to true in preparation 
			for Task 6, where we implement loop subdivision.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>
			To implement loop subdivision, we first need to iterate through every vertex in the input mesh. At each existing vertex, 
			we use its degree n to calculate its new position according to the new position algorithms. Using its degree, the updated 
			position of an old vertex is (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum, where n is the vertex 
			degree and u is a constant whose value depends on the degree. If n = 3, u = 3/16, otherwise, u = 3/(8n). Also, 
			original_neighbor_position_sum can be calculated by summing up a vertex's neighboring vertices' positions using halfedge traversal. 
			We then stored these updated positions in each respective vertex's newPosition member variable.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Next, we can compute the vertex positions associated with new vertices that split an existing edge and place them in the 
			edge's respective newPosition member variable. To do this, we can iterate through our given mesh's edges and use each edge's 
			halfedge to obtain the four vertex positions relevant for its new position calculation. Given a new vertex splitting the 
			shared edge (A, B) between two triangles (A, B, C) and (A, B, D), its position is 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D), and we can 
			store that in the edge's newPosition member variable.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, we can split every original edge in the mesh (making sure not to iterate over edges that result from our procedure, as 
			the loop will then infinitely recurse). To achieve this, we stored all of the original edges in an EdgeIter object and then 
			iterated through each of them while creating new vertices using splitEdge and updating their positions by accessing each edge's 
			newPosition member variable. While iterating, we also set each new vertex's inNew member variable to true to flag them for 
			flipping later.
		</p>


		<p>
			Then, we can iterate through all of the edges in our mesh, and if an edge connects a new and old vertex, then we can add it 
			to an EdgeIter object to be flipped later. Once we've gotten our “list” of edges to be flipped, we iterate through them and 
			apply flipEdge to each of them.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, we need to iterate through each vertex in the mesh and update its position to its newPosition.
		</p>

		<p>Here is loop subdivision in action.</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				</td>
			  </tr>

			  
  
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>
			Taking a look at this torus, we can see that it is initially very angular and contains a lot of edges. 
			Then, as we loop subdivide more and more, the sharp corners and edges of a mesh tend to round out and 
			become smooth. If we want to reduce this effect, then we can preprocess our mesh by edge splitting across 
			the edges. It's not a perfect prevention method, but it preserves some angularity.

		<p>Now, let's take a look at loop subdivision on a cube.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/task6cube1.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Defuault cube with no loop subdivisions.</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/task6cube2.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Defuault cube with 1 loop subdivision.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/task6cube3.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Defuault cube with 2 loop subdivisions.</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/task6cube4.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Defuault cube with 3 loop subdivisions.</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			
			  
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>
			When performing loop subdivision on the cube, we see that the more loop subdivision iterations we go through, 
			the more the mesh veers off asymmetrically. This is due to the cube only having one diagonal edge on each side. 
			Since the two triangles that make up each side are the same as each other but flipped in the opposite direction, 
			when they are subdivided, the subdivision creates new edges in the opposite direction.
		</p>

		<p>
			To alleviate this, we can preprocess each side of the cube to be made up of equilateral triangles before 
			performing loop subdivision. This can be done by applying one edge split to each of the diagonal edges on 
			each side of the cube, which can be seen here. Having each side of the cube be comprised of equilateral 
			triangles ensures that everything will subdivide evenly in each direction.
